To run the app on Windows, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory containing "compile.bat" and "run.bat".

2. Run the command "compile.bat" without quotes.

3. Open a second terminal and navigate to the same directory.

4. In both terminals, run the command "run.bat". This will start the app. You will see further instructions  printed in the terminal once the app has started. To get right to the game, just enter the character "p" without quotes in both terminals when it prompts you to enter a command and the game will begin.



To run the app on Linux, follow these steps:

1. Install Java if it isn't already installed.

2. Open a terminal in the directory containing "compile.sh" and "run.sh" and run the commands "chmod +x compile.sh" and "chmod +x run.sh" without quotes.

3. Follow the same instructions as above for Windows, but you will run "./compile.sh" and "./run.sh" instead of "compile.bat" and "run.bat".
